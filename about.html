								<h4 class="tm-history-title">History of our restaurant</h4>
								<p class="tm-mb-p">A recent industry push has sought to highlight the modern accomplishments and contributions of women in food, particularly chefs & women in Business. But women have long been behind some of the most impressive achievements in the food world throughout history, and there’s no better time to celebrate them than on International Women’s Day on March 8.</p>
								<p>These women have created legacies that range from the farm-to-table movement to Southern food as a leading cuisine, winning awards and setting new standards along the way that has paved the way for more women to follow in their footsteps. Learning about them and highlighting their work will hopefully allow for even more profound change to come.</p>
								
								<p>From the icon that is Jennifer Soft and her goofy brand that casualized French cuisine to lesser-known names such as Buwei Yang Chao and her invention of the term “stir-fry,” these are ultra-inspiring women in food who have not only shaped the history of food, cooking, and eating, but also changed the world for the better.</p>
